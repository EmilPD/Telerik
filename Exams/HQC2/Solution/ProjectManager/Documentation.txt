Bugs:

#1 - In FileLogger in Method "Error(object msg)" - there is a comment that prevent logging of error messages.
#2 - In CommandFactory - there is no createuser in switch/case - a added it.
#3 - in createUser command
#4 - in createTask command
#5 - in CommandProcessor there is unreachable code " if (commandsList.Split(' ').Count() > 10)"

Bottleneck:

#1 - BuildCommand()
